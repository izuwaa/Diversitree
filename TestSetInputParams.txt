computeDiversity, 1, #, 0 means compute the diversities of captured solutions 1 means write the captured solutions to .csv file
computeDiversityFromCsv, 0, #, 0 means we DON'T Have a .csv file hence run GAMS or SCIP, 1 means we are given a .csv file with solutions hence just compute the diversity of the k most diverse solutions; k is represented by the parameter - requestedNumberSolutions
